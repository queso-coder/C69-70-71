       <h5 class="text-success text-capitalize">i visited athens, greece when i was 11 years old</h5>

       <p class="text-muted">The city's ruins and many museums make
         it a major tourist destination. It was selected to host the 2004 Olympic Games. When I went to Classical Athens, 
        I felt like I was goint to brea down some ancient artifact when me and my family were next to buildings. When we took a guided tour, 
      the people told us how hardly anything has been disturbed or moved since tiime it has occured as a result of how precious and historical each building and artifact was there.

       <p class="text-muted"> I visisted orange beach alabama with my mom, dad, sister, and cousin. We went there for Christmas Break and we stayed at a small house for that time. We spent a lot of time at the beach and had a very close encounter with a family of dolphins. I had a swim compettition with my sister and I barely beat her.

<p>I watched with my family in 3D and it didn't enhance much to the movie. A great bonding and enlighting movie although the story moves slow.
   You don't really have to watch the first movie first to get an understanding of the movie but you have to familiarize yourselves with the characters to be able to follow.
  If you want to watch it, I would wait until it comes out onto streaming platforms lilke Netflix or Hulu. One thing that was oustanding compared to the other details in the movie is the graphics. 
  It was super realistic at the same time a bit too much for 3D.</p>

<p>I watched this movie first in the theaters with my sister and we both loved it. It had a very intersting storyline and is fit 
  for all ages to watch which is a hard thing to accomplish especially since is in a comic style animation movie. The background music is very fitting and enhances the movies qualities.
  You have to watch the first movie to know the charcaters and to be able to follows, espcecially since it is a fastpaced movie. This movie is also very humorous and full of comedy. There is a good balnce betwee all aspects of this movie.
  Would highly reccomend for family movie night.
